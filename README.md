Ceylon Formatter
================

The goal of this project is to provide a formatter for Ceylon source code that can be embedded in the Eclipse and IntelliJ IDE, as well as directly called from the command line.

Current status
--------------

Right now, this project is still in the "hacking around" phase. I'm sure an Ant buildfile and other stuff will come soon :)
